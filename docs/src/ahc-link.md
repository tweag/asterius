# Using `ahc-link`/`ahc-dist`

`ahc-link` is the frontend program of Asterius. It takes a Haskell `Main` module
and optionally an ES6 "entry" module as input, then emits a `.wasm` WebAssembly
binary module and companion JavaScript files, which can then be run in
environments like Node.js or browsers.

`ahc-dist` works similarly, except it takes the pseudo-executable file generated
from `ahc-cabal` as input. All command-line arguments are the same as
`ahc-link`, except `ahc-link` takes `--input-hs`, while `ahc-dist` takes
`--input-exe`.

## Quick examples

Compiling a Haskell file, running the result with `node` immediately: `ahc-link
--input-hs hello.hs --run`

Compiling for browsers, bundling JavaScript modules to a single script:
`ahc-link --input-hs hello.hs --browser --bundle`

Compiling a Cabal executable target: `ahc-cabal new-install --installdir . hello
&& ahc-dist --input-exe hello --run`

## Reference

### `--input-hs ARG`

The Haskell `Main` module's file path. This option is mandatory; all others are
optional. Works only for `ahc-link`.

The `Main` module may reference other local modules, as well as packages in the
`asterius` global package database.

### `--input-exe ARG`

The pseudo-executable file path. A pseudo-executable is produced by using
`ahc-cabal` to compile a Cabal executable target. This works only for
`ahc-dist`, and is also mandatory.

### `--input-mjs ARG`

The ES6 "entry" module's file path. If not specified, a default entry module
will be generated, e.g. `xxx.hs`'s entry script will be `xxx.mjs`. The entry
module can either be run by `node`, or included in a `<script>` tag, depending
on the target supplied at link time.

It's possible to override the default behavior by specifying your own entry
module. The easiest way to write a custom entry module is to modify the default
one:

```javascript
import * as rts from "./rts.mjs";
import module from "./xxx.wasm.mjs";
import req from "./xxx.req.mjs";

module
  .then(m => rts.newAsteriusInstance(Object.assign(req, { module: m })))
  .then(i => {
    i.exports.main();
  });
```

`xxx.wasm.mjs` and `xxx.req.mjs` are generated at link-time. `xxx.wasm.mjs`
exports a default value, which is a `Promise` resolving to a
`WebAssembly.Module` value. `xxx.req.mjs` exports the "request object"
containing app-specific data required to initialize an instance. After adding
the `module` field to the request object, the result can be used as the input to
`newAsteriusInstance` exported by `rts.mjs`.

`newAsteriusInstance` will eventually resolve to an Asterius instance object.
Using the instance object, one can call the exported Haskell functions.

### `--output-directory ARG`

Specifies the output directory. Defaults to the same directory of `--input-hs`.

### `--output-prefix` ARG

Specifies the prefix of the output files. Defaults to the base filename of
`--input-hs`, so for `xxx.hs`, we generate `xxx.wasm`, `xxx.req.mjs`, etc.

### `--verbose-err`

This flag will enable more verbose runtime error messages. By default, the data
segments related to runtime messages and the function name section are stripped
in the output WebAssembly module for smaller binary size.

When reporting a runtime error in the `asterius` issue tracker, it is
recommended to compile and run the example with `--verbose-err` so there's more
info available.

### `--no-main`

This is useful for compiling and linking a non-`Main` module. This will pass
`-no-hs-main` to GHC when linking, and the usual `i.exports.main()` main
function won't be available.

Note that the default entry script won't work for such modules, since there
isn't an exported `main` functions, but it's still possible to export other
Haskell functions and call them from JavaScript; do not forget to use
`--export-function=..` to specify those functions.

### `--browser`

Indicates the output code is targeting the browser environment. By default, the
target is Node.js.

Since the runtime contains platform-specific modules, the compiled
WebAssembly/JavaScript code only works on a single specific platform. The
pseudo-executable generated by `ahc` or `ahc-cabal` is platform-independent
though; it's possible to compile Haskell to a pseudo-executable, and later use
`ahc-dist` to generate code for different platforms.

### `--bundle`

Instead of generating a bunch of ES6 modules in the target directory, generate a
self-contained `xxx.js` script, and running `xxx.js` has the same effect as
running the entry module. Only works for the browser target for now.

`--bundle` is backed by [`webpack`](https://webpack.js.org) under the hood and
performs minification on the bundled JavaScript file. It's likely beneficial
since it reduces the total size of scripts and doesn't require multiple requests
for fetching them.

### `--tail-calls`

Enable the WebAssembly tail call opcodes. This requires Node.js/Chromium to be
called with the `--experimental-wasm-return-call` flag.

See the "Using experimental WebAssembly features" section for more details.

### `--optimize-level=N`

Set the optimize level of `binaryen`. Valid values are `0` to `4`. The default
value is `4`.

Check the relevant source code in `binaryen` for the passes enabled for
different optimize/shrink levels
[here](https://github.com/WebAssembly/binaryen/blob/master/src/passes/pass.cpp).

### `--shrink-level=N`

Set the shrink level of `binaryen`. Valid values are `0` to `2`. The default
value is `2`.

### `--ghc-option ARG`

Specify additional ghc options. The `{-# OPTIONS_GHC #-}` pragma also works.

### `--run`

Runs the output code using `node`. Ignored for browser targets.

### `--debug`

Switch on the debug mode. The memory trap will be enabled, which replaces all
load/store instructions in WebAssembly with load/store functions in JavaScript,
performing aggressive validity checks on the addresses.

### `--yolo`

Switch on the yolo mode. Garbage collection will never occur, instead the
storage manager will simply allocate more memory upon heap overflows. This is
mainly used for debugging potential gc-related runtime errors.

### `--gc-threshold=N`

Set the gc threshold value to `N` MBs. The default value is `64`. The storage
manager won't perform actual garbage collection if the size of active heap
region is below the threshold.

### `--no-gc-sections`

Do not run dead code elimination.

### `--export-function ARG`

For each `foreign export javascript` function `f` that will be called, a
`--export-function=f` link-time flag is mandatory.

### `--extra-root-symbol ARG`

Specify a symbol to be added to the "root symbol set". Root symbols and their
transitive dependencies will survive dead code elimination.

### `--output-ir`

Output Wasm IRs of compiled Haskell modules and the resulting module. The IRs
aren't intended to be consumed by external tools like `binaryen`/`wabt`.

### `--console-history`

The `stdout`/`stderr` of the runtime will preserve the already written content.
The UTF-8 decoded history content can be fetched via
`i.stdio.stdout()`/`i.stdio.stderr()`. These functions will also clear the
history when called.

This flag can be useful when writing headless Node.js or browser tests and the
`stdout`/`stderr` contents need to be compared against a file.
