By default we avoid actually printing results.
Given that we deal with floating point these vary
between platforms quite a bit without actually being wrong.
So we just evaluate the result without showing it.

If you want to check the validity of results you can
pass print as additional argument to get the old
behaviour.

The old Makefile along with (some of) the expected results
can be found in the old subdirectory.
